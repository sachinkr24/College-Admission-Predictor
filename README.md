# College-Admission-Predictor
I analyzed and visualized datasets with pandas and matplotlib, developed and optimized various regression models using GridSearchCV, and created a Linear Regression model to predict graduate admissions. Leveraged Python libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for efficient data manipulation and predictive modeling.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Proficient in exploring and visualizing datasets using pandas and matplotlib. This includes data cleaning, feature analysis, and distribution plotting to gain insights from data.

- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Implemented a variety of regression models including Linear Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Utilized GridSearchCV to find the best-performing algorithm for predicting graduate school admission chances.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict the probability of admission to graduate programs based on factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and research experience.

- **Python Programming**: Demonstrated strong Python skills, leveraging libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for efficient data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks.
