# College-Admission-Predictor
I analyzed and visualized datasets with pandas and matplotlib, developed and optimized various regression models using GridSearchCV, and created a Linear Regression model to predict graduate admissions. Leveraged Python libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for efficient data manipulation and predictive modeling.

#Features
• Data Analysis and Visualization: Demonstrated proficiency in exploring and visualizing datasets using pandas and
matplotlib, including data cleaning, feature analysis, and distribution plotting.
• Machine Learning Model Development: Implemented various regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso, SVR,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN) and used GridSearchCV to identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting
graduate school admission chances.
• Predictive Modeling: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict the probability of admission to graduate
programs based on factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and research experience.
• Python Programming: Showcased strong Python skills, utilizing libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and
matplotlib to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks
